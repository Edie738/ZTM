Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter. 


.class
#id
*
element
element, element (h, p apply to p all that is applied to h)
element element (eg h p meaning all ps inside h. even h is itself is not affected)
element > element (h2 > p meaning all ps whose direct parent is h2. if a div comes after h2 before p, it doesn't work)
element + element
:hover
:last-child
:first-child
!important (not recommended)


What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity
-Importance
-Source Order
